## THE CONTEXT:

It is estimated that two-thirds of all known coral species can be classified as "deep-sea corals". These corals exhibit a diversity similar to those of their shallow-water relatives, but they do not form symbiotic relationships with algae, do not obtain energy from sunlight (instead feeding from microorganisms in the water), and are much more resilient to cold temperatures.

Also similar to their shallow water counterparts, deep sea corals are hosts to many other forms of biodiversity. They are also extremely slow growing, and as a result, slow to recover from ecological or anthropogenic disturbance[2].

This analysis will seek to more deeply understand the environments in which deep sea corals are more likely to appear. 

## THE DATA:

The data used for this analysis comes from NOAA's Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program (DSCRTP), and is housed at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Invertebrate Zoology Collection. It contains decades worth of data regarding deep sea corals, their taxa, spatial data, and collecting data. It is an open source data set, that is consistently being updated. (See link in the citations section, to take a look for yourself!)[3]

Here are some details from the dataset:

- Number of records: 30,850 
- Number of coral records: 24,768 
- Number of sponge records: 6,082 
- Records with images: 245 

Obviously, we have a lot of data points to work with here. Let's begin by loading our libraries and reading in the data!

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
# Load libraries
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(terra)
library(stars)
library(spData)
library(spDataLarge)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(rnaturalearthhires)
library(emmeans)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
# Read in data
corals <- read_csv(here("data", "deep_sea_corals_1843_c601_9be4.csv"))
```

The deep sea corals dataset I chose also includes deep sea sponges. Since this analysis wants to focus on corals, I'll have to filter that data out. In addition, there are several columns on the dataframe that I know won't be helpful for my analysis (for example, collector data, institution data, or columns that contains a lot of NAs.) In addition to filtering out the sponge data, I will filter out those unwanted columns as well. 

```{r}
# Filter data to only include columns I want
corals <- corals %>% 
  clean_names(case = "snake") %>% # Change column names to snake_case
  select(scientific_name, phylum, genus, species, individual_count, latitude, longitude, depth_in_meters, country) %>% # Choose columns I want
  filter(phylum %in% c("Cnidaria")) # Filter to exclude sponges and NA row

```

I know that in order to properly visualize my data, I'm going to want to make some maps. However, I also want the latitude and longitude data to be easily handled during any linear model calculations, so I decide to make a separate dataset variable, that transforms the lat long data into geometric data that I can easily add to tmaps for visualizations. 

```{r}
corals_transformed <- corals %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
               crs = st_crs(4326)) %>% 
              filter(st_is_valid(.))

```

Let's take a look at the result of our well filtered data! This data cleaning will enable us to run effective and easy to understand data analysis in the next few steps. 

```{r}
# Create a table using kable and format it with kableExtra
kable(head(corals), format = "html", caption = "Preview of Filtered Global Coral Data") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```


## THE EXPLORATION:

### VISUALIZATION

I want to take a look at the whole scale of my data set. To do this, I decide to make a global map.

```{r, fig.width=14, fig.height=10}
world <- spData::world

tm_shape(world) +
  tm_fill(col = "continent",
          palette = c("slategray", "snow3", "slategray2", "slategray3", "slategray4", "lightslategrey", "lightsteelblue4", "snow4"),
          title = "Continents") +
  tm_shape(corals_transformed) +
  tm_dots(col = "phylum",
          palette = "pink2",
          size = 0.05,
          border.col = "black",
          title = "Data Point") +
  # tm_compass(type = "4star",
  #            size = .05,
  #            position = c("left", "top")) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Global Coral Observations",
            title.position = c("center", "top"),
            title.snap.to.legend = FALSE,
            #frame = TRUE, 
            #legend.frame = TRUE,
            legend.outside = TRUE)
```

From this global map, we can see the huge volume to coral observations present in our dataset. In order to get a little more focus in my model, I decide filter the datset to a specific country, and run my analysis on that. 

It could be interesting to, in the future, run the same analysis on each continent, and then cross-compare them. This would reveal interesting insights about different continents and species. Politically, it could also be an interesting view into how collecting bias might affect the results of such an analysis, since we can see that some continents contain more sample points than others. Unfortunately, this could be due to the fact that certain countries and regions are more studied than others, due to data collecting bias in the environmental sector.[1]

For the purpose of this study, however, I will filter the coral data to the Philippines. The Philippines is an area known for its coral diversity and it's popularity in the diving community. I am curious to see how DEEP SEA corals are represented in the region, rather than the dive-able shallow coral systems. 


```{r}
phil_coral <- corals %>% 
  filter(country %in% "Philippines") %>% 
  mutate(
    latitude = as.numeric(latitude),
    longitude = as.numeric(longitude),
    depth_in_meters = as.numeric(depth_in_meters),
    latitude_rounded = round(latitude, 1)
  ) %>% 
  add_count(latitude_rounded, name = "obs_count")

# Transformed dataset for mapping
phil_coral_transformed <- corals_transformed %>% 
  filter(country %in% "Philippines")

```

```{r}
# Create a table using kable and format it with kableExtra
kable(head(phil_coral), format = "html", caption = "Preview of Filtered Philippines Coral Data") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

```{r}
# Get data for base map of Philippines
ph <- ne_countries(scale = 10, country = "Philippines", returnclass = "sf")

luzon <- ph %>%
  st_crop(
    xmin = st_bbox(ph)$xmin %>% as.numeric(),
    xmax = st_bbox(ph)$xmax %>% as.numeric(),
    ymin = 13.5,
    ymax = 18.5
  ) %>%
  st_transform(25391)
```

```{r, fig.width=14, fig.height=10}
tm_shape(ph) +
  tm_polygons(col = "name",
          palette = c("slategray", "snow3", "slategray2", "slategray3", "slategray4", "lightslategrey", "lightsteelblue4", "snow4"),
          title = "Philippines") +
  tm_shape(phil_coral_transformed) +
  tm_dots(col = "phylum",
          palette = "pink2",
          size = 0.1,
          border.col = "black",
          title = "Data Point") +
   tm_compass(type = "8star",
              size = 2,
              position = c("left", "top")) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Coral Observations \nin the Philippines",
            title.position = c("center", "top"),
            title.snap.to.legend = FALSE,
            #frame = TRUE, 
            #legend.frame = TRUE,
            legend.outside = TRUE)
```

           color = "pink2",
           size = 1) +

```


```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = phil_coral,
             aes(x = latitude_rounded,
                 y = obs_count,
                 color = depth_in_meters)) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "skyblue", high = "black") +
  labs(x = "Latitude",
       y = "Number of Deep Sea Corals Observed",
       title = "Depth, Latitude, and Observation Count") +
  theme_bw()

```


### Hypothesize

Null: There is no relationship Alternate: There IS a relationship

## Analysis

Method: Interactions model
```{r}
max(phil_coral$depth_in_meters)
```


```{r}
# Create an interactions model
interactions <- lm(obs_count ~ latitude_rounded + depth_in_meters + latitude_rounded:depth_in_meters,
                   data = phil_coral)
summary(interactions)
```

```{r}
# Simple slopes of depth by latitude
emtrends(interactions, specs = c("latitude_rounded"), var = "depth_in_meters")
```

```{r}
# P-values of slopes of depth by latitude
test(emtrends(interactions, specs = c("latitude_rounded"), var = "depth_in_meters"))
```

```{r}
emmip(interactions, latitude_rounded ~ depth_in_meters, at=list(depth_in_meters=18:2050), CIs = FALSE)
```
